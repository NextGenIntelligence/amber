	* rowl1/vm-insn.rlc : added `list_len' instruction.

2011-10-11  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-assemble.rlc : fixed a GC-related bug.
	Objects embedded in the byte array of an assembler object wouldn't be
	GCed in the old version. The new assembler stores objects to vector
	at assemble-time and bytecode_set() function embeds them to
	byte-sequence.
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc, rowl1-numeric.rlc :
	    removed compile_unary and compile_binary, moved them to
	    lib/rowl/syntax.rl
	* lib/rowl/syntax.rl : changed the operator for long-identifier from
	"." to "::".
	* rowl1/vm-prim-vector.rlc : added prim_Xvector_assign().

	* rowl1/rowl1-interp.rlc, lib/rowl/syntax.rlc : added Import statement.
	* vm-main.rlc : fix a bug in memset().
	* vm-prim-io.rlc : added open, close, chdir and fchdir.

	* rowl2/sample : added
	* lib/rowl/io.rlc, rowl1/rowl1-io.rlc : added several IO functions.
	* rowl1/rowl1-node.rlc :

	* rowl1/rowl1-builtin.rlc : removed.
	* several tiny bug fixes

	* rowl1/rowl1-node.rlc : pretty_print_full()
	* rowl1/rowl1-assemble.rlc : print_bytecode()
	* lib/rowl/syntax.rlc : changed priorities of operators.
	    - 'else' 19->18
	    - ':'    18 -> 19
	* rowl1/rowl1-matching.rlc, librowl/syntax.rlc :
	    - changed to compile Quote{x} as SymbolP{x} in function parameters,
	      and eliminate the operator for SymbolP (originally its a "`").
	    - changed the operator for Quote from "!" to "`".
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc : added compilers for While and Return.
