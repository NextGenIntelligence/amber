	* lib/rowl/syntax.rl: Fixed definition of Compile(out,env,x=>y)
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc: Added compile_lambda.

2011-10-19  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc, rowl1-node.rlc, lib/rowl/syntax.rl: Added
	quasiquote expression, and fixed semantics of quote/quasiquote/unquote
	in reference to R5RS.
	* misc/vim/syntax.rl: several fixes.
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc: Fixed bugs of DefineFunction and AppendFunction.

	* rowl1/rowl1-parse.rlc : allow to write multi-line non-indented
	expression if the precedent line ends with a prefix or an infix operator.
	example:

	+
	1   # => +1

	1 +
	2   # => 1 + 2

	* rowl1/rowl1-tuple.rlc : added
	* rowl1/rowl1-parse.rlc : changed syntax.
	    - Parenthesisless tuple like 'a, b, c'.
	      The priority of operator ',' is 16 (one level prior than assignment operators).
	      example:

	      x, y = y, x   # Tuple{x, y} = Tuple{y, x}
	      1, 2 + 3, 4   # Tuple{1, 2+3, 4}

	    - Disable to write multiple expressions in one-line.

	      puts("Hello") puts("World")   # NG
	* rowl1/rowl1-node.rlc : added pp_tuple().

	* rowl1/rowl1-list.rlc : added
	* rowl1/vm-insn.rlc : added `list_len' instruction.

2011-10-11  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-assemble.rlc : fixed a GC-related bug.
	Objects embedded in the byte array of an assembler object wouldn't be
	GCed in the old version. The new assembler stores objects to vector
	at assemble-time and bytecode_set() function embeds them to
	byte-sequence.
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc, rowl1-numeric.rlc :
	    removed compile_unary and compile_binary, moved them to
	    lib/rowl/syntax.rl
	* lib/rowl/syntax.rl : changed the operator for long-identifier from
	"." to "::".
	* rowl1/vm-prim-vector.rlc : added prim_Xvector_assign().

2011-10-08  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-interp.rlc, lib/rowl/syntax.rlc : added Import statement.
	* vm-main.rlc : fix a bug in memset().
	* vm-prim-io.rlc : added open, close, chdir and fchdir.

2011-10-05  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-node.rlc : added to_builtin_sym() and make_expr_user().
	* rowl1/rowl1-numeric.rlc : fixed a bug.
	* rowl2/sample : added
	* lib/rowl/io.rlc, rowl1/rowl1-io.rlc : added several IO functions.
	* rowl1/rowl1-node.rlc :
	    - added new builtin object types InputFileStream and OutputFileStream.
	* rowl1/rowl1-builtin.rlc : removed.
	* several tiny bug fixes

2011-10-04  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-assembler.rlc :
	    - added put_operand_[byte/short/int].
	    - fixed name conflicts of put_sotrel and put_loadl.
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc :
	    - fixed a bug in allocation of local variables.
	* lib/rowl/io.rlc : added
	* rowl1/rowl1-matching.rlc : fixed a bug in same_head_pat().

2011-10-03  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* rowl1/rowl1-node.rlc : pretty_print_full()
	* rowl1/rowl1-assemble.rlc : print_bytecode()
	* lib/rowl/syntax.rlc : changed priorities of operators.
	    - 'else' 19->18
	    - ':'    18 -> 19
	* rowl1/rowl1-matching.rlc, librowl/syntax.rlc :
	    - changed to compile Quote{x} as SymbolP{x} in function parameters,
	      and eliminate the operator for SymbolP (originally its a "`").
	    - changed the operator for Quote from "!" to "`".
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc : added compilers for While and Return.
	* rowl1/rowl1-assemble.rlc : bugfix of put_store_arg().

2011-10-01  nineties <nineties48@gmail.com>

	* Changelog : added.
	* rowl1/rowl1-numeric.rlc : check division by zero.
	* rowl1/rowl1-compile.rlc :
	    - compilers for following expressions are added.
		Block,If,Else
	    - implemented short-cut optimization for conditional expression.
	    - changed to use concrete patterns for Compile().
	* rowl1/vm-insn.rlc : erase if_true and if_false instructions
	    changed representation of true/false from 1/0 to symbols 'true' and 'false'.
